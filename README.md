# **_Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock_**

This game is an extention of the standard Rock, Paper Scissor game with a twist. This expanded version with Lizard & Spock in the mix makes things intresting. This version of the game was first seen on TV on the popular show The Big Bang Theory, when sheldon played this game against his friend Raj to decide what show they will watch.

## Design Choices

* ### Typography
    The fonts chosen were 'Noto Sans Avestan' for the body and 'Noto Serif Georgian' to fall back to respectively. 
    * These fonts were chosen to compliment the look of the game area while giving a strong bold heading appearance.

 * ### Colour Scheme
    * The colour scheme eventually chosen is based on a White background, with a game card background that is a mix of Magenta, Yellow and Black, with the main text colour of black and a range of colours for the options in the game to give a pleasent contrast between the different colours.

# Features

This Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock game is set up to give the player a fun experience of an old game they would have liked to play when seeing it on TV.

## Existing Features  
  * ### 5 Playable Options

    5 playable options are in the game, 2 more than the standard Rock, Paper, Scissor game bringing the total number of possible outcomes from (27 combinations) to (199 combinations). With many more posible outcomes, come many more enjoyable moments.

    As a fan of the TV show you may be excited to play the game but remembering back when sheldon explained the rules he may of been a bit too fast so if you need some help the rules of the game they are clearly explained below the restart button. There is also a default image displayed before the player makes a choice to help explain the rules.
